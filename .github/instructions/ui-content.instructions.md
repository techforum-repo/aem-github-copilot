# Instructions for `ui.content`

## Scope
Use this guidance for mutable content, templates, policies, experience fragments, and other content/package XML under `ui.content`.

## Key rules
- Keep `ui.content` limited to mutable content and configuration that belongs with content ownership.
- Do not place immutable application paths such as `/apps` or `/libs` here.
- Avoid `rep:policy`, `authorizable`, `/oak:index`, `/home`, or `/libs` content unless explicitly required and reviewed.
- Review non-default filter modes such as `merge` or `replace` carefully because they can alter existing authored content during install.
- Avoid overlapping filter roots with other embedded packages in `all`.

## Review focus
- mutable versus immutable path separation
- ACL or authorizable content in packages
- filter mode changes with upgrade risk
- unintended impact on existing authored content
