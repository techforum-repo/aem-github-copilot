# Instructions for Content Fragments and headless delivery

## Content Fragment models

- Define CF models under `/conf/<project>/settings/dam/cfm/models/` — never under `/content`.
- Model definition XML must be placed in `ui.content` — models are mutable, not immutable.
- Every field must have a `fieldLabel` and a stable `name` — changing `name` breaks existing fragments.
- Use `required` sparingly — required fields block fragment creation in workflows.
- Fragment variations must be accounted for in any consuming code.

## GraphQL persisted queries

- Store persisted queries under `/conf/<project>/settings/graphql/persistedQueries/`.
- Always use persisted queries in production — ad-hoc queries are disabled by Dispatcher in AEMaaCS.
- Never expose sensitive content paths or JCR structure details in query responses.
- Paginate large result sets — use `limit` and `cursor`-based pagination.

## Headless delivery

- All headless endpoints must go through the AEM GraphQL servlet — never expose raw JCR APIs.
- Dispatcher must allow `/graphql/execute.json/*` for persisted query execution.
- CORS configuration must be in `ui.config` — not hardcoded in servlet filters.
- Test CF model changes against existing fragments before deploying — field renames are breaking changes.
- Keep Java-specific Content Fragment access rules in a companion Java-scoped instruction file so they apply when editing `core` code.

## Review focus

- Are CF model changes backward-compatible with existing fragments?
- Are persisted queries used rather than ad-hoc queries?
- Is pagination applied to queries that could return large result sets?
- Is CORS configured via OSGi in `ui.config`?
